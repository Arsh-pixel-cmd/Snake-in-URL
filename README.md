## 🚀 Project Overview

Step into a **retro-inspired, browser-based Snake game** that literally lives in the **URL bar**!  
This project takes the classic Snake experience and transforms it into a **dynamic URL playground**, combining **coding creativity** with **interactive fun**.  

- Play a fully interactive Snake game without leaving your browser.  
- Catch apples 🍎, avoid walls 💀, and watch the URL animate in real time.  
- Vibrant gradient backgrounds that react to your score.  

**Note:** This game is optimized for **laptop/desktop browsers only**. Mobile play is possible with touch buttons, but the URL animation is best experienced on a full-sized screen.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🎮 Fully interactive Snake controls via **Arrow Keys**.  
- 🍎 Dynamic food system that increases your score.  
- 🌈 Adaptive gradient backgrounds based on score.  
- 🖥️ Playground width dynamically adjusts to screen size.  
- 💀 Game Over detection with restart functionality.  
- 🔗 Live URL updates — watch the Snake and food move in the browser URL bar itself!

## 🖥️ How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your **desktop/laptop browser**.
3. Use the **Left (←) and Right (→) arrow keys** to control the snake.  
4. Eat the 🍎 to score points and watch the URL animate!  
5. Avoid the walls 💀 — press **Space** to restart after a game over.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

This is not just another web game — it’s a **creative blend of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and browser APIs**.  

- Shows mastery of **dynamic DOM updates**, **event handling**, and **history API manipulation**.  
- Demonstrates **problem-solving and creative thinking** — turning the browser’s URL into a game canvas!  
- Perfect showcase for **frontend ingenuity** in a portfolio.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
